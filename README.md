### Dependencies
These set up instructions assume that you already have the following installed:
- Bundler
- Yarn
- Redis
- PostgreSQL

Fork this repository and run `bundle` to install Ruby dependencies.

Run `bin/yarn install` to install Webpacker/JS dependencies.

Copy `.env.example` to your own `.env` file. `.env.example` is already
pre-populated with dummy environment variables for local
development and testing.

#### Set Up

Ensure PostgreSQL is running and run `rake db:setup` to set up a development
database and run migrations locally.

Start the Redis server with `redis-server`.

Run `bundle exec rails s` to run the Rails server.

#### Running Tests

You will need Chrome and Chromedriver to run the tests, which you can install with Homebrew:

```
brew cask install google-chrome chromedriver
```

Run `rake db:test:prepare` to set up your test database.

Run the test suite with `bundle exec rspec`.

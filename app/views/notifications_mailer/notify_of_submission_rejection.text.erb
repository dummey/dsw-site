Hello!

Thank you for submitting a session proposal for consideration for Denver Startup Week!

Unfortunately, your session "<%= @submission.title %>" has not been selected for inclusion in the <%= Date.today.year %> Denver Startup Week program.

We had a tremendous number of high-quality session proposals this year. The energy and passion that this community has for sharing knowledge and insight is truly awe-inspiring. Unfortunately, the logistics of the week dictate that we can only select a fraction of these proposals for inclusion in the final Denver Startup Week schedule.

We rely heavily on the voting process to help us determine the sessions and topics the community is most excited to hear about. However, when determining the final program, we do take a number of other factors into account including (but not limited to) the relevance of the session topic to the goals of the week, the quality and thoughtfulness of the proposal, the balance of topics (subject, audience, and industry vertical) for the week, and the balancing the speakers/companies represented during the week. Unfortunately, this sometimes means we do not select sessions that received a large number of votes.

But this doesn't mean we don’t want you to be a part of this incredible week!

First and foremost, we want to see you out there! Sign up and attend anything that suits your fancy. Registration will open very soon, so stay tuned for that.

Second, as the details for the events coalesce over the coming weeks, we do sometimes have opportunities arise to participate in panels and other sessions that find themselves in need of additional speakers. While it’s difficult to foresee exactly which opportunities will come up, we would love to have you involved in some capacity and will reach out if we see a potential fit.

Finally, we are always very much in need of passionate volunteers to help ensure the week goes off without a hitch. We also do have a few sponsorship opportunities still available as well. If either of these are of interest please reply back.

Thank you again for supporting the startup community here in Denver!

Sincerely,

The Denver Startup Week Organizing Committee

Hello!

Congratulations! Your session "<%= @submission.title %>" has been selected to be part of the <%= @submission.track.name %> Track program during Denver Startup Week <%= Date.today.year %>.

<%- if @submission.time_assigned? %>

<%- else %>
We have not scheduled it for a timeslot yet but will be doing so shortly.
<%- end %>

We know this is a lengthy email but please read all of the following information as there are important, mandatory steps and dates which will require action from you.

Please reply to this email to let us know (as soon as you are able, but no later than EOD <%= (Date.today + 4.days).strftime('%A %B %-e') %>) that you’re willing and able to present this session at the time indicated above. Unfortunately, due to the size of the event, we have very limited ability to accommodate requests for time slot changes. If we don’t receive confirmation from you by that time, we will cede your slot to another session.


SESSION LOGISTICS

As session organizer, you will have a 90 minute slot available to fill as you see fit. You are not required to fill the entire allotted time. For example, many presenters elect to do a 60-75 minute session followed by 15-30 minutes of Q&A. Others opt to do a shorter session followed by a longer discussion, or a 90-minute workshop sessions.


VENUES

We are currently working on booking venues for each session based on schedule availability, track locality, and expected attendance. If you have already secured a venue on your own, please let us know. Otherwise, we will reach out with additional logistics on your assigned venue in the next few weeks.

TITLE & DESCRIPTION UPDATES

We have created a section of the site where you can submit updates to the title and description for your session, should you wish to do so. For more information, visit https://www.denverstartupweek.org/panel-picker/mine and follow the instructions there. Over the course of the next few weeks, we’ll be rolling out a function to indicate individual speakers for your sessions as well - stay tuned for that!

We will be announcing the full schedule and opening registration for attendees the week of July 18th, so we encourage you to get your updates in as soon as possible. You can preview what your session detail page will look like at <%= schedule_url(@submission) %> (though please note that registration and schedule building are not yet active).

MANDATORY PRESENTER ORIENTATION

To help ensure consistency and ease logistics for all our sessions, we ask that all session organizers attend one of our orientation sessions. The sessions cover event logistics, volunteer coordination, session promotion, branding, and more. We’re offering the session at two different times (once during the business day and once in the evening) to try to accommodate as many schedules as possible.

We are still finalizing locations and dates for these sessions, and will be in touch as soon as we have them dialed in.


OTHER EVENTS

We will have 300+ other events throughout the week and would love to see you take part in some of them. The full schedule will be publicized and registration will open the week of July 18th.

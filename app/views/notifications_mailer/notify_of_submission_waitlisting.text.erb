Hello!

Thank you for submitting a session proposal for consideration for Denver Startup Week!

We had an tremendous number of high-quality session proposals this year. The energy and passion this community has for sharing knowledge and insight is truly awe-inspiring. However, the logistics of the week dictate that we can only select a fraction of these proposals for inclusion in the final Denver Startup Week schedule.

Your session "<%= @submission.title %>" has been waitlisted for inclusion in the <%= Date.today.year %> Denver Startup Week program. While we believe your proposal merits inclusion, we do not currently have an open slot for it. However, as the schedule solidifies over the course of the next few weeks, an opening may become available. We will be in touch with a definitive answer soon.

If you are no longer interested and would like to remove your proposal from consideration, please reply back to let us know.

Thank you again for supporting the Denver startup community!

Sincerely,

The Denver Startup Week Organizing Committee
